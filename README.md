Description
-----------

MailboxMod is a no-frills addition to the base game meant for server play.

Known Problems
--------------
* shift clicking bypasses isValidForSlot allowing everything to be placed in the slot (should be just written letters)
* boxes sometimes unregister (the list is lost, dont know how to fix that, I should research worldsavedata more closely)
* the tick handler and packet management are a mess
